/* The input-to-outcome dialog lifecycle, as a state machine that can be checked.
 *
 * This is the plan's transition table expressed as data and a reducer, so the
 * rules that matter can be exercised without a browser, a server or a run:
 *
 *   * an invalid submission keeps the dialog open, preserves the draft and
 *     submits nothing
 *   * a submission in flight cannot be submitted again — and disabling a button
 *     is not what enforces that; this is
 *   * cancelling before Submit invokes nothing at all
 *   * a refusal preserves the draft; an uncertain delivery stays recoverable and
 *     is never resubmitted automatically
 *   * a very fast run may already have its outcome when admission returns, so
 *     the transitions must sequence without inventing execution time
 *   * dismissing an outcome does not erase evidence; a result indicator remains
 *     and the same outcome can be reopened
 *
 * The reducer returns the next state and the *effects* a provider should carry
 * out. It performs none of them. In particular it never writes domain state:
 * animation and focus are consequences of a transition, not participants in it.
